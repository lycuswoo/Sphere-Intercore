# Sample: MT3620 M4 real-time Intercore application - Bare Metal GPIO
### Description
This sample was based from [Mediateck Baremetal GPIO example](https://github.com/MediaTek-Labs/mt3620_m4_software/tree/master/MT3620_M4_Sample_Code/BareMetal/MT3620_RTApp_BareMetal_GPIO)
- On-board LED_Red(GPIO8), LED_Green(GPIO9) and LED_Blue(GPIO10) are used as GPIO output.
- GPT0 is used for LED Blinking
- ISU0 UART interface is used to print the output log.
- Intercore Communication
  - RT App will receive LED light options from HL App and light up the corresponded LED
  - RT App will toggle the case for on the text received from HL App and send back to HL App together with a customized message
  - Customized message can be modify by changing the code. Look for variable "cust_msg" in main.c - line 252
  
(Note, UART port number in main.c could be changed from **OS_HAL_UART_ISU0** to **OS_HAL_UART_PORT0** to use M4 dedicate UART port.)  
Please refer to the [MT3620 M4 API Rerference Manual](https://support.mediatek.com/AzureSphere/mt3620/M4_API_Reference_Manual) for the detailed API description.

### Prerequisites
* **Hardware**
    * [AVNET MT3620 Starter Kit](https://www.avnet.com/shop/us/products/avnet-engineering-services/aes-ms-mt3620-sk-g-3074457345636825680/)
    * or [Seeed MT3620 Development Kit](https://aka.ms/azurespheredevkits)
    * or other hardware that implements the [MT3620 Reference Development Board (RDB)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-sphere/hardware/mt3620-reference-board-design) design.
* **Software**
    * Refer to [Azure Sphere software installation guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-ca/azure-sphere/install/overview).
    * A terminal emulator (such as Telnet or [PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/) to display the output log).
